### TODOs:
- Add `"ignore": "comments"` to the `"block-no-empty"` once stylelint fixes
this bug https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/issues/4109.
- capabilities explained
- demonstrate features in example app
- how to run/build/test/lint
- devDependencies explained
- Editor integration guide (i.e. vscode stylelint plugin)
- jsconfig.json


- @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
- @babel/plugin-transform-runtime
- @babel/polyfill
- jest
- add ImageminWebpackPlugin (prod)
- bundle analyzer plugin
- sanitize/normalize css?
- bundlesize
- pre-commit hooks (linting)
- webpack.progressPlugin
- \[css-loader - loaderImports\] Pretty sure this is only necessary for css not scss, since imports are inlined by sass-loader before this in the chain.
- should postcss-flexbugs-fixes loader plugin be used?
- verify out-of-the-box webpack4 optimization settings.
- Need to add cache busting for favicon?
